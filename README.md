# TO-DO APP 📝

This is a basic JavaScript-based To-Do App built using only HTML and JS.

### 💡 How it works:
- The app uses browser `prompt()` to take input from the user
- User can type specific commands to perform actions

### 🛠️ Available Commands:
- **"list"** → Displays all tasks
- **"add"** → Adds a new task
- **"delete"** → Removes a task by its index
- **"quit"** → Exits the app

### 📁 Files:
- `index.html` → Structure of the page and instructions
- `apps.js` → All JavaScript logic

> This is a console-based interactive app. Open it in the browser and check the Developer Console (press `F12` or `Ctrl+Shift+I`) to interact.

### ✨ Features:
- Add unlimited tasks
- View task list anytime
- Simple and beginner-friendly logic
